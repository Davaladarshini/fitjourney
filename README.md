# 💪 FITJourney: Your AI-Powered Fitness Companion

**FITJourney** is a comprehensive, personalized fitness application designed to guide users through their health and wellness goals using cutting-edge AI, real-time webcam pose analysis, and integrated mindfulness tools. It serves as a unified hub for smart workouts, body tracking, and mental well-being.

## ✨ Key Features

FITJourney leverages modern technology to provide a highly personalized fitness experience:

### 🤖 Smart & Adaptive Workouts

* **AI Goal Mapping:** Generates complete workout roadmaps based on natural language goal descriptions (e.g., "lose 5kg" or "run a 5k"). Includes a built-in health safety check that overrides weight loss goals for underweight users.
* **Adaptive Plans:** Creates dynamic 7-day plans that automatically adjust the intensity, sets, and reps of future workouts based on logged user feedback (e.g., if a workout was rated "Very Easy," the AI increases difficulty).
* **BMI Recommendation:** Provides a highly personalized 3-day workout plan and health tips, generated by Gemini, based on the user's current BMI and any reported health issues or injuries.
* **Custom Builder:** Intuitive interface to build, save, and start personalized workout routines with custom sets, reps, and durations.

### 👁️ Real-time Webcam Form Trainer

Utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to provide instant, angle-based form correction and repetition counting using the user's webcam:
* **Supported Exercises:** Bodyweight Squats, Squat Overhead Press (OHP), Alternate Lunges with Torso Rotation, and Jumping Jacks.
* **Auto-Classify Mode:** Automatically detects and begins counting reps for the exercise the user is performing among a set list (Squat, Push-up, Lunge, Jumping Jack, Sit-up).

### 🧘 Mindfulness & Wellness Companion

* **FitBot Chat:** A friendly AI companion using the Gemini API and TextBlob sentiment analysis to provide supportive, empathetic advice based on user mood and notes. Users can chat, log their mood, and view history.
* **Breathing Visualizer:** Guided sessions for powerful breathing techniques (Box Breathing, 4-7-8, Calming, Energizer) with visual cues and optional audio guides.
* **Guided Meditation:** Library of guided sessions for deep relaxation, sleep, and focus with speech synthesis enabled.
* **Yoga Studio:** Features a visual/audio guide for Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutations) and options to generate personalized yoga sequences based on goals.

### 📅 Booking & Profile Management

* **Trainer Booking:** A multi-step form allows users to book a virtual or in-person consultation with a trainer. A real email notification is sent to the designated trainer's email address upon submission (using Flask-Mail).
* **Profile:** Centralized profile management that calculates BMI and uses Gemini to extract and list specific health conditions/injuries from raw user text for workout adaptation.
